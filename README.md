...gently down the stream [operations].

Summary
-------

This library is meant to encapsulate what I found to be the most common sets of functionality associated with XML and JSON serialization/deserialization of objects to/from files and memory to a data stream.

Notes
-----

All code in this library has been composed in a self-documenting fashion and styled for readability where possible. All public members, methods, and constructors have complete XML documentation for use with VS Intellisense.

This solution, including unit tests and architectural models, was created, debugged, and deployed using [Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate with MSDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#Visual_Studio_2012) (link contains addtional references). The solution may not open properly if you try using an earlier or less feature-saturated version of Visual Studio. If a later version is used, be sure to check the cloned solution against original source code to ensure that compatiblity changes haven't significantly altered existing functionality.

Instructions
------------

To get your machine ready for development with this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory you cloned your repository to.
3. Locate the Visual Studio 2012 solution file.
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio (2012 or later)

Viola! You're good to go!
